Small test project to see if texttheater/produce automation tool can help write
generic recipes for producing all results for all cases in various datasets for
various models. The objective was to be able to do that in a way that looked 
descriptive and without have to write one target rule for each dataset/model
possible combination.

You can produce all the results with:
    
    produce results/

You can produce all results for a model with:

    produce results/{model}

And you can produce all results for a given model and dataset with:

    produce results/{model}/{dataset}
